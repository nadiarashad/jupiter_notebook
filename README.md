## This repo contains a programme displaying all prime numbers between 1 and 100

It uses the programming language Python3 along with Jupyter Notebook to create the visual outcome.

Jupyter Notebook is a web application which allows users to create a file which incorporates code alongside markdown text.

Using Jupiter Notebook I was able to use cyrytography to encrypt/decrypt personal data and display the output as a widget box as well as a CSS grid
