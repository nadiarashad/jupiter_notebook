    "|   How would a new user know how to clone and run your code? | I created a read me file which included a step by step instruction guide explaining how to clone and run my repository|\n",
    "|   Prevention of committing of secrets and IDE artefacts to your repository.  | Although the repository is public, I have not set any collaborators, therefore no other person can contribute to the repository|\n",
    "|   Speed of algorithm  | I used a few different types of functions and finally set on using Sive of Eratosthenes, there are faster sieves available however I felt this is one I could explain the code for.<br><br> I tested the speed of the algorithm using '%%time' which displayed the 'Wall time' allowing me to compare the speeds of different functions |\n",
    "|   Display output  | I used Jupyter Notebook which allowed me to display markdown as well as code in the same document. Jupyter Notebook also used CSS, so I was able to display a grid of the prime numbers as well as using the ipywidget to display a more visually appealing list |\n",
    "|   Protecting your own personal information e.g birthdates, photos etc.)  |  I used the getpass module which prompts the user for a password before displaying the output data. <br><br>I also used the cryptography package which uses symmetric encryption (one key for multiple users) to encrypt a file which could contain passwords and other sensitive content |\n",
